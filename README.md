# Mutual-Fund-Risk-Classification
This project predicts risk level of mutual funds through classification algorithms

- **Model Performance Summary**  
  - Random Forest (RF): Highest accuracy (**86.23%**).  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM): Second highest accuracy (**84.76%**).  
  - Logistic Regression (LR): Accuracy **83.16%**.  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Accuracy **82.67%**.  
  - Decision Tree (DT): Lowest accuracy (**82.19%**).  

- **Insights**  
  - Random Forest is the most effective model for mutual fund risk classification based on accuracy.  
  - SVM also shows promise with a competitive accuracy score.  

- **Next Steps**  
  - Apply **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning across all models to optimize their performance.  
  - Focus on RF and SVM for further fine-tuning and improvements.
